  ## Usage

  After installing dependencies, create an env file to store the database name, password, and user information.  Next, run the supplied schema in your MySQL database.  The seed file is not required to run the blog, but if you wish to, you can seed the database by entering npm run seed in your terminal.  
  
  Next enter 'npm start' in your terminal to start the server.  Once the server is running you see the homepage in your brower, sign-up to create a user profile and begin blogging!
